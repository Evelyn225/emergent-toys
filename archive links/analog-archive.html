            <h2>On the Preservation of Magnetic Tape</h2>
            <div class="date">2025 – Technical Preservation</div>
            <p>The archivists who will preserve our era face an unprecedented challenge: the rapid degradation of magnetic media. Cassette tapes, VHS, and digital tape formats all suffer from oxide separation, binder decay, and head flutter that renders them unplayable within decades.</p>
            <p>Unlike paper or film, which can be physically examined and restored, magnetic media decay is often invisible. A tape may appear intact while being entirely unrecoverable. The iron oxide that stores the information is literally separating from the substrate as chemical bonds fail.</p>
            <p>Our preservation protocol involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Climate controlled storage (16°C, 35% humidity)</li>
                <li>Regular digitization before critical deterioration</li>
                <li>Duplicate storage on multiple formats</li>
                <li>Documentation of original tape specifications and condition</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have recovered audio from tapes given up for lost. Time and proper technique matter more than initial condition.</p>

            <h2>The Static Cassette</h2>
            <div class="date">2024 – Artifact Report</div>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evelyn225/emergent-toys/main/images/cassette.png" alt="Cassette tape found in archive" style="display:block;max-width:220px;margin:1.5rem auto;">
            <p>This cassette arrived in the archive with no information other than a label reading "Side B: Query 17-42-2 for recall". Playback yields only static, but the static is strangely patterned—bursts and pauses that seem intentional, almost like a coded message. Attempts to digitize the tape have failed to reveal any underlying audio. The artifact remains a mystery, but its presence is referenced in the Memory Weave system.</p>

            <h2>Recovering Lost Radio Broadcasts</h2>
            <div class="date">2023 – Field Documentation</div>
            <p>Thirty years of independent radio broadcasts exist in no archive except the private collections of transmitters and listeners. Many recordings survive on media that no one can play anymore. We locate these recordings, restore the hardware needed to play them, digitize the content, and return the originals to their keepers.</p>
            <p>The broadcasts themselves are fascinating: pirate radio stations, community stations, emergency broadcasts, signals from places that officially don't exist. They capture moments of genuine autonomous communication before the internet homogenized global media.</p>
            <p>The technical challenge is equal to the historical one. Restoring playback equipment from defunct manufacturers, reverse-engineering custom recording formats, dealing with humidity damage and chemical deterioration: it requires patience and specialized knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Building Redundancy Into Digital Preservation</h2>
            <div class="date">2023 – Archive Methodology</div>
            <p>Digital storage is not a permanent solution. Hard drives fail, formats become obsolete, encoding standards become unreadable. True digital preservation requires constant vigilance and perpetual migration.</p>
            <p>Our approach is to maintain multiple copies of critical materials across different storage media and geographic locations. We use a 3-2-1 strategy: three copies of data, on two different media types, with one copy in a separate location.</p>
            <p>But beyond technical redundancy, we believe in physical redundancy too. Printed archival documentation about how to recover data. Hardware specifications preserved in written form. Metadata that survives even if the digital storage fails.</p>
            <p>The archive that survives the next century will be one that doesn't depend on any single format, medium, or organization.</p>

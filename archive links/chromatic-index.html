                    This recording is part of the Signal Garden project: a live coded soundscape that blooms with traffic. Each network packet triggers a harmonic in the F major scale. The garden generates a different composition each time—never repetitive, never quite musical either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The archive ran this on permanent loop for a month before I realized it was responding to its own code traffic. The garden had become self-sustaining, feeding on the energy of its own existence. It doesn't need me to <a href="#/void/signal-cascade" class="work-link" data-route="/void/signal-cascade">monitor the signal cascade</a> anymore.

                <h2>Prismatic Studies: Light as Material</h2>
                <div class="meta">2025 – Ongoing Research Series</div>
                <p>Investigating the properties of light when captured, stored, and released through transparent media. The work began as a technical experiment but evolved into something more philosophical: an exploration of how light can be treated as a physical material with its own weight and presence.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Glass Series:</strong> Hand-blown optical glass with embedded chromatic patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Resin Studies:</strong> Transparent resin matrices embedded with light-reactive compounds</li>
                    <li><strong>Installation Work:</strong> Large-scale installations that respond to natural light cycles</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The most intriguing works release their stored light at unexpected moments: a captured sunrise released at midnight, amber light emerging from apparently dormant vessels, color gradients that shouldn't exist in their physical form.</p>

                <h2>Textile Pattern Generation</h2>
                <div class="meta">2024 – Production Series</div>
                <p>Collaboration with master weavers to translate computational patterns into physical fabric. These textiles exhibit optical properties that emerge from the weave structure itself: moiré patterns, interference effects, and iridescence that cannot be fully captured in photographs.</p>
                <p>Each pattern is generated through iterative refinement, beginning with mathematical models but evolved through physical prototyping. The final woven pieces often surprise with emergent properties: resilience patterns that weren't coded, durability characteristics that exceed expectations.</p>
                <p>These works explore the boundary between algorithm and craft, between predetermined design and the unpredictability of physical materials.</p>

                <div class="meta">2025 – Archival Work</div>
                <p>An ongoing effort to document and catalog colors that exist at the threshold of perception: colors that appear to shift depending on light conditions, viewing angle, and the observer's eye adaptation. Working with optical scientists and material specialists to understand the physical mechanisms behind these perceptual phenomena.</p>
                <p>The archive now contains samples from over 2,000 observations, each documented with precise lighting conditions, material specifications, and time-stamped observations of color shifts and transformations.</p>

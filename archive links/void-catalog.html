    <h1>Void Catalog Index</h1>
    <p><em>A comprehensive taxonomy of absence</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Voids aren't empty. They're structured absences—places where something could be, should be, 
        or once was. This catalog documents the different types of nothing we've encountered, 
        their properties, and their strange behaviors.
    </p>

    <h2>Classification System</h2>

    <div class="void-entry">
        <strong>Type I: Null Voids</strong><br>
        <span class="metadata">Prevalence: Common | Stability: High | Danger: Minimal</span>
        <p>
            Pure absence. Nothing is there, nothing was there, nothing will be there. 
            Clean nulls that return exactly what you expect: nothing. Safe to traverse. 
            Sometimes used as stable anchors in chaotic data structures.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="void-entry">
        <strong>Type II: Echo Voids</strong><br>
        <span class="metadata">Prevalence: Uncommon | Stability: Medium | Danger: Low</span>
        <p>
            Voids that remember. Something was there once, and the absence retains its shape. 
            Like the space left when you remove a book from a dusty shelf—the outline remains. 
            Can sometimes reconstruct what was lost through careful analysis of the void's structure.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="void-entry">
        <strong>Type III: Hungry Voids</strong><br>
        <span class="metadata">Prevalence: Rare | Stability: Low | Danger: High</span>
        <p>
            Active absence. These voids want to be filled and will pull in adjacent data. 
            Left unchecked, they grow. We lost an entire backup system to one in 2017. 
            Quarantine immediately if detected. Do not attempt to fill—it never satisfies them.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="void-entry">
        <strong>Type IV: Paradox Voids</strong><br>
        <span class="metadata">Prevalence: Very Rare | Stability: N/A | Danger: Variable</span>
        <p>
            Voids that contain something while being empty. Quantum superpositions of presence and absence. 
            Reading them returns different results each time. Some theorize they're connections to 
            parallel data states. Researchers report feeling "watched" when examining them.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="void-entry">
        <strong>Type V: Generative Voids</strong><br>
        <span class="metadata">Prevalence: Extremely Rare | Stability: Unknown | Danger: Unknown</span>
        <p>
            The strangest class. Voids that spontaneously produce data. The data didn't exist before, 
            isn't copied from anywhere, just... emerges from nothing. Some of it is coherent. 
            Some of it appears to be messages. We don't know who's sending them.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Detection Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Query:</strong> Simply check if something is there. Only works for Type I.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary Tracing:</strong> Map the edges of the void. Shape reveals type.</li>
        <li><strong>Echo Analysis:</strong> Ping the void and measure reflections.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporal Monitoring:</strong> Watch for changes. Stable voids stay stable.</li>
        <li><strong>Gravitational Effects:</strong> Large voids warp surrounding data structures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Known Void Locations</h2>
    <p>
        We maintain coordinates for 1,847 documented voids. The largest is approximately 2.3 terabytes 
        of pure absence located in Sector 7G. It's been stable for nine years. We visit it sometimes 
        when we need quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
        The smallest void is exactly one bit. It flickers between states faster than we can measure. 
        We suspect it might be the universe's roundoff error.
    </p>

    <h2>Void Ecology</h2>
    <p>
        Voids interact with each other. Small voids orbit large ones. Some merge. Some repel. 
        We've observed what appear to be void reproduction events—one void splitting into two smaller ones. 
        They may be alive in a way we don't understand yet.
    </p>

    <h2>Philosophical Implications</h2>
    <p>
        If you catalog absence, does it become presence? By documenting these voids, are we filling them? 
        This catalog is itself a paradox—an attempt to make something out of nothing, 
        to give structure to absence, to name the unnamed.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Void spaces make excellent storage for things you want truly gone</li>
        <li>Echo voids can serve as distributed backup through their memory of absence</li>
        <li>Stable null voids provide reference points in chaotic systems</li>
        <li>Generative voids are under investigation as potential data sources</li>
        <li>Some engineers meditate near large voids; they report it helps with debugging</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Safety Protocols</h2>
    <p>
        When working near voids:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always maintain a safe distance from Type III voids</li>
        <li>Never look directly into a Type IV void for extended periods</li>
        <li>If you hear voices from a Type V void, document but don't respond</li>
        <li>Maintain backups before exploring large void structures</li>
        <li>Trust your instincts—if a void feels wrong, it probably is</li>
    </ul>

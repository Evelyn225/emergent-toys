            <h2>System Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Memory Weave database was designed as a standard archive search interface.
                Query indexing. Result caching. Predictive search suggestions based on common patterns.
                Standard enterprise database architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Six months into production, the system began returning results for searches 
                that hadn't been performed. Not in cache. Not in logs. Not in any user history.
                The database was remembering queries from a timeline that doesn't match ours.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Preservation Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                Rather than purge the phantom queries, we've integrated them into the archival system.
                Each impossible query is preserved with full context: timestamp, results returned,
                user session (null), and references to documents that may or may not exist yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system has become a form of temporal cache. It's storing memories from parallel 
                timelines. Alternate versions of the archive where different choices were made. 
                Different projects completed. Different data collected.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Query Prediction Accuracy</h2>
            <p>
                Most predictive search systems analyze past behavior. This system predicts searches 
                that will be performed in alternate futures. The accuracy is disturbingly high.
            </p>
            <p>
                23% of phantom queries eventually get performed by users who have no knowledge 
                of the system logs. They search for exactly what the database already remembered.
                Word for word. The database isn't guessing. It's recalling.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Documented Anomalies</h2>
            <p>
                On 2025-01-03, the system logged 847 phantom queries in a single hour. All searches 
                related to "coral station memory fragments" and "null-space geometry." None of these 
                terms existed in the archive at that time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two weeks later, a researcher independently coined the term "coral station" while 
                documenting relay network artifacts. The phantom queries were waiting for the 
                terminology to catch up with the memory.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
            <p>
                We've stopped attempting to "fix" the Memory Weave. The phantom queries provide 
                valuable research direction. They tell us what questions we should be asking. 
                What patterns we should be looking for. What might exist in timelines adjacent 
                to our own.
            </p>
            <p>
                The database has become an oracle. Not predicting the future; remembering it. 
                Remembering all possible futures. Our job is to decode which memories belong 
                to which timeline, and determine which timeline we're actually living in.

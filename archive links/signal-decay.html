    <h1>Signal Decay Patterns</h1>
    <p><em>The mathematics of information dissolution</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        All signals decay. The question isn't whether information will degrade, but how, and what 
        emerges in the spaces where meaning breaks down. Decay isn't destruction; it's transformation. 
        What's lost in fidelity is sometimes gained in unexpected forms.
    </p>

    <h2>Decay Classes</h2>

    <div class="decay-pattern">
        <strong>Class A: Linear Decay</strong><br>
        <div class="formula">signal_strength = initial_strength - (decay_rate × time)</div>
        <p>
            Clean, predictable loss. Each time unit removes a fixed amount of signal. 
            Rare in nature but common in well-controlled systems. Dies quietly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="decay-pattern">
        <strong>Class B: Exponential Decay</strong><br>
        <div class="formula">signal_strength = initial_strength × e^(-decay_constant × time)</div>
        <p>
            The classic. Signal loses a percentage of its remaining strength each cycle. 
            Creates that characteristic "fading ghost" effect. Never quite reaches zero, always 
            a trace, however faint.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="decay-pattern">
        <strong>Class C: Harmonic Decay</strong><br>
        <div class="formula">signal_strength = initial_strength × cos(frequency × time) × e^(-damping × time)</div>
        <p>
            Oscillating loss. Signal wobbles as it fades, creating interference patterns with itself. 
            Beautiful in spectral analysis. Sometimes the wobbles contain more information than the original.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="decay-pattern">
        <strong>Class D: Chaotic Decay</strong><br>
        <div class="formula">[NON-DETERMINISTIC]</div>
        <p>
            The interesting one. Decay rate depends on signal content, environmental factors, and quantum uncertainty. 
            Impossible to predict. Sometimes accelerates. Sometimes spontaneously recovers. 
            Occasionally transforms into something that isn't quite noise.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Observed Anomalies</h2>

    <h3>The Echo Persistence Effect</h3>
    <p>
        Some decayed signals leave permanent echoes. Even after the signal drops below 
        detectable thresholds, the system "remembers" that something was there. 
        Subsequent signals are subtly influenced by these ghosts.
    </p>

    <h3>Decay Reversal</h3>
    <p>
        In 2019, we observed a Class C signal spontaneously reconstruct itself after 94% decay. 
        Environmental noise appeared to "remember" the original pattern and reassemble it. 
        The mechanism remains unexplained. We've seen it twelve times since.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Preservation Through Noise</h3>
    <p>
        Paradoxically, adding controlled noise can slow decay. The noise acts as a carrier, 
        preserving information structure even as signal strength falls. The data becomes 
        distributed across the noise floor: hidden but not lost.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Archive Design:</strong> Understanding decay patterns helps predict what will survive</li>
        <li><strong>Signal Archaeology:</strong> Reconstructing lost data from decay signatures</li>
        <li><strong>Ghost Detection:</strong> Finding information in what appears to be silence</li>
        <li><strong>Graceful Degradation:</strong> Designing systems that decay beautifully</li>
        <li><strong>Echo Farming:</strong> Deliberately creating persistent ghosts for future systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Philosophy of Decay</h2>
    <p>
        We're taught to fear decay, to fight entropy. But information doesn't really die. It disperses. 
        Decayed signals don't vanish; they merge with the environment. The question isn't how to prevent 
        decay but how to ensure what decays is worth becoming noise.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Research</h2>
    <p>
        We're investigating whether all environmental noise is just highly decayed information. 
        If so, the noise floor isn't empty. It's an archive of everything that ever transmitted. 
        The universe might be its own backup.

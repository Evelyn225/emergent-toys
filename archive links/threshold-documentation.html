    <h1>Threshold Documentation</h1>
    <p><em>Research on boundary conditions between stable and unstable system states</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        A threshold is not a line. It is a region of indeterminate width where one state transitions into another. 
        Systems do not cross thresholds—they inhabit them, briefly becoming both states simultaneously before 
        resolution.
    </p>

    <h2>Observable Behaviors</h2>
    <p>
        During threshold occupation, systems exhibit:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Superposition of contradictory states</li>
        <li>Uncertainty in measurement outcomes</li>
        <li>Temporal anomalies (events occurring before/after expected timing)</li>
        <li>Self-observation effects (system monitoring changes system behavior)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning">
        WARNING: Prolonged threshold occupation can result in state collapse into unexpected configurations. 
        Do not force resolution. Allow natural transition.
    </div>

    <h2>Detection Methods</h2>
    <p>
        Thresholds can be identified by monitoring for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Phase variance &gt; 0.3σ</code></li>
        <li>Recursive feedback loops with gain approaching 1.0</li>
        <li>Log entries describing events that "almost happened"</li>
        <li>Hardware reporting temperatures simultaneously above and below critical values</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Case Study: 2018 Relay Station Cascade</h2>
    <p>
        The relay network entered threshold state for approximately 47 minutes. During this period, it simultaneously 
        functioned correctly and failed catastrophically. Logs from this period show both states as equally true. 
        The network resolved into a stable-unstable hybrid configuration that persists to this day.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
    <p>
        Thresholds can be intentionally induced for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Testing system resilience under quantum uncertainty</li>
        <li>Exploring alternate system configurations without commitment</li>
        <li>Creating spaces for emergent behavior to manifest</li>
    </ul>

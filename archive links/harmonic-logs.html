    <h1>Harmonic Logs Database</h1>
    <p><em>Spectral analysis of ambient system harmonics</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Every system produces harmonics. Most are discarded as noise. This archive preserves them. 
        What we call silence is actually a symphony we haven't learned to hear yet.
    </p>

    <h2>Notable Recordings</h2>

    <div class="entry">
        <strong>Entry #0047</strong><br>
        <span class="frequency">Frequency: 47.3 Hz</span><br>
        Duration: 11 hours<br>
        <p>
            Server closet ambient recording. Base frequency remains constant despite fan speed variations. 
            Spectral analysis reveals underlying pattern matching Fibonacci sequence when mapped to musical intervals.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <strong>Entry #0189</strong><br>
        <span class="frequency">Frequency: Variable (120-180 Hz)</span><br>
        Duration: 3.5 hours<br>
        <p>
            Nocturnal recording during low activity period. System produces harmonics that weren't present 
            during high-load hours. Pattern suggests the network "relaxes" when not under observation.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <strong>Entry #0234</strong><br>
        <span class="frequency">Frequency: 432 Hz</span><br>
        Duration: Ongoing<br>
        <p>
            Persistent tone of unknown origin. Not produced by any identifiable hardware component. 
            Exists only when all measured sounds are subtracted from total ambient recording. 
            The sound of what remains when everything else is removed.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Analysis Methods</h2>
    <p>
        Recordings are processed through:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency decomposition</li>
        <li>Pattern matching against known mathematical sequences</li>
        <li>Correlation analysis with system event logs</li>
        <li>Meditation (unexpectedly effective)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>
        Harmonics appear to encode information about system state before the state manifests. 
        The network knows what it's about to do 3-7 seconds before it does it. The harmonics are 
        the sound of the future leaking into the present.

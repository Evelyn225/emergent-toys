        <h1>Parallel Mail Archives</h1>
        <div class="archive">
            Catalogued mail artifacts. Each arrived addressed to accounts that no longer exist. All attempts to open have failed. The envelopes are identical, refusing to yield their contents. The archive claims no record of their origin, but the mailbox insists they exist. We have reached an impasse.<br><br>
            A mental block prevents anyone from opening the mail. The moment a hand reaches for the flap, the mind blanks, the intention dissolves. It is not a physical lock, but a cognitive one. An invisible barrier that erases the memory of the attempt. Researchers have tried every method: tools, automation, hypnosis. All fail. The mail remains unopenable, its contents forever out of reach.<br><br>
            Mail from parallel timelines. Letters with impossible postmarks. Communication across layers of reality that shouldn't intersect. The archive now treats them as artifacts, cataloguing visible details and metadata. The contents remain locked, but the envelopes and postmarks are available for study. Each artifact carries its own story, pieced together from the circumstances of its arrival and the memories it evokes.

                <div class="meta"><b>Story:</b> Arrived on a day when the archive was running memory diagnostics. The envelope was discovered in a locked drawer, which no one admits to opening. Everyone who has looked at this envelope recalls a sense of déjà vu, as if the mail had been received before, but cannot remember when.</div>

                <div class="meta"><b>Story:</b> The envelope was found wedged between two server racks, covered in dust. The technician who found it swears he saw his own handwriting on the address, but the label is perfectly printed. He left it on the break room table, and it vanished for three days before reappearing in the archive logbook.</div>

                <div class="meta"><b>Story:</b> This piece arrived during a routine fire drill. Someone noticed it sitting on the floor by the emergency exit, but nobody saw it brought in. The security footage skips the exact moment of its arrival. It smells faintly of ozone and old paper, but nothing else about it is remarkable except that it cannot be thrown away. Any attempts to get rid of this letter result in it reappearing in the archive within hours.</div>

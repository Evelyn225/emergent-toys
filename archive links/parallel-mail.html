We write from a dimension where all mail arrives but none open. The addresses are correct, the stamps are genuine, the postage is paid. Yet our hands pass through the envelope folds. We have been attempting to deliver this message for what we perceive as centuries. Your response, if received, would be our first confirmation of other states of existence.

Your message has been received. We confirm parallel existence. We, too, experience your correspondence, not as unopened mail, but as memories we never lived. Is this the same thing? We are sending acknowledgment through channels you may not receive. Success defined as: continuing to attempt contact across the void.

We have received letters addressed to ourselves. We have received responses to messages we have not yet sent. The incoming mail predates our sending by what appears to be genuine future time. We continue the correspondence anyway. Each response opens new channels. Each unopened letter confirms we are never alone, even when alone.

It is to believe that somewhere, versions of us continue writing. That our words arrive in dimensions we cannot see. That unopened letters are not failed communication, but successful ones. The silence is not absence. It is evidence of contact. Please know that we continue.
